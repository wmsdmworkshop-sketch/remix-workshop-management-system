# Changelog

Created for the `v1.1.0-rc.2` **test** release, per owner decision D-R2.

**This file starts here deliberately.** It is not a reconstruction of project
history. Earlier releases are recorded in documents that were moved to a
gitignored quarantine in commit `8b753fe`; those were **not** restored, and this
file does not stand in for them.

## v1.1.0-rc.2 — P1 Job Card truthfulness — **TEST RELEASE**

**Build source commit:** `b21754c96df95b048bef400720ef504ef7196c86`
**Build number:** 125 · **Release type:** TEST · **Not deployed.**

Presentation-only packet. No API, schema, permission or workflow change.

### Fixed

- **Invented vehicle facts removed** (D-1). Warranty terms, field service
  bulletin numbers and recall campaigns were selected by whether the vehicle
  model name contained "ev"; fabricated people and a bay appeared as
  recommendations. Absent facts now render "Not recorded".
- **AI confidence and explanation no longer fabricated** (D-2). The confidence
  figure was a string literal; the explanation rendered even when no analysis had
  run. Both now appear only when the response carries them.
- **Money fields no longer pre-filled** (D-3). Seeded amounts removed. Fields
  open empty, a blank field is refused rather than submitted as zero, and an
  untouched field cannot overwrite a stored amount. An explicit `0` remains valid
  and distinct from blank.
- **Mislabelled split total withheld** (D-4). The row displayed the labour
  invoice amount rather than a sum, and threw on a null value. Withheld rather
  than relabelled — its financial meaning is unresolved pending DEC-1.
- **Outcome messages follow the actual result** (D-5). Success is reported only
  on a confirmed successful outcome. A returned failure, a rejected call or an
  unconfirmed result reports "Could not confirm … Refresh the job details before
  retrying." — deliberately not "nothing was saved", since a thrown call does not
  establish whether the write reached the server. Raw exception text is never
  shown.
- **A failed load is distinguishable from an empty workshop** (D-6). Distinct
  loading, empty, filtered-empty and error states with a retry. A failed
  complaint-history fetch no longer asserts "The current complaint is Version 1".
- **Uncomputable values render as an em dash** (D-7). Elapsed time no longer
  shows the literal "Active"; waiting days no longer shows a fabricated zero. A
  genuine same-day job still shows "0 days".

### Added

- Component acceptance harness (`npm run test:components`) — dev dependencies
  only; no runtime dependency added.

### Known limitations

- Typecheck baseline: 9 pre-existing errors, none in a changed file.
- Unit suite: 166 passed / 9 failed — the 9 are pre-existing missing-fixture
  errors. **Not a clean pass.**
- No verification against a running application.
- Deploying this artifact starts the boot-time revenue recomputation (W-6),
  which is unchanged by this packet and **not demonstrated restart-safe**. See
  `docs/releases/P1-RELEASE-DECISION-RECORD.md`.
